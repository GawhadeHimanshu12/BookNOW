## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
* npm (v9.x or later) or yarn
* MongoDB (Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running. For full transaction support as implemented in the controllers, this instance **must be configured as a replica set**. MongoDB Atlas free tier provides this by default.)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> BookNOW
    cd BookNOW
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the server directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        # yarn install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying `server/.env.example` (if you create one) or by using the structure provided during codebase generation. Populate it with your:
        * MongoDB Atlas connection string (`MONGODB_URI`) - **ensure it points to a replica set for transactions.**
        * JWT Secret (`JWT_SECRET`)
        * Email service credentials (e.g., Mailtrap or SendGrid for `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`)
        * `FRONTEND_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
        * Default admin credentials for seeding (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME`)
    * The port for the backend is typically set in the `.env` file (`PORT=5001`).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the client directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../client 
        # (from the server directory, or directly to BookNOW/client from project root)
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        # yarn install
        ```
    * The client primarily uses Vite's proxy to connect to the backend, so direct API URLs in a client-side `.env` are usually not needed. The `vite.config.js` handles proxying `/api` requests.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * In the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port specified in your `.env`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    * In a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * This will typically start the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser.

### Seeding Data

The project includes scripts to seed initial data:

1.  **Seed Default Admin User:**
    * Ensure your backend server is running or at least that your `.env` file in the `server` directory has the `MONGODB_URI` and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_...` variables set.
    * In the `server` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm run seed:admin
        ```
    * This will create a default admin user if one doesn't already exist with the specified email.

2.  **Seed Sample Data (Movies, Venues, etc.):**
    * In the `server` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm run seed:data
        ```
    * To destroy all sample data (excluding users managed by `seed:admin`):
        ```bash
        npm run seed:data:destroy
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Ensure you have a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables (refer to the `.env` example provided during code generation for details):

* `PORT`
* `MONGODB_URI` (Crucial: For transactions, this must point to a MongoDB replica set, e.g., Atlas free tier or higher)
* `JWT_SECRET`
* `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`
* `NODE_ENV`
* `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_SECURE`
* `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME`
* `FRONTEND_URL`

## üìú Available Scripts

In the `server` directory:
* `npm start`: Starts the server in production mode (uses `node server.js`).
* `npm run dev`: Starts the server in development mode with `nodemon` for auto-restarts.
* `npm run seed:admin`: Creates or updates the default admin user.
* `npm run seed:data`: Populates the database with sample movies, venues, etc.
* `npm run seed:data:destroy`: Removes the sample data populated by `seed:data`.

In the `client` directory:
* `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server for the frontend.
* `npm run build`: Builds the frontend for production (output to `client/dist`).
* `npm run lint`: Lints the frontend code.
* `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.
